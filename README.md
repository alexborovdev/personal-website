# Personal Website (HTML • SCSS • JavaScript • Vite)

A modern personal website built with clean **HTML**, scalable **SCSS**, and **Vanilla JavaScript**, using **Vite** as the build tool.

The project follows **Feature-Sliced Design (FSD)** architecture and is built around **OOP-style JavaScript classes** for UI logic and interactions.  
Strong focus on **structure**, **accessibility**, **performance**, and **animation-driven UX**.

This project demonstrates framework-free front-end architecture with production-level code organization.
