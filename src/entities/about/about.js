	description: [
		`I’m 25 years old, based in New Jersey, with a background in graphic design.
		I started working in Adobe Illustrator, which helped me develop structured thinking
		and attention to detail that still influence how I approach UI.`,

		`I focused on front-end development and building interfaces that
		solve product and business problems.
		I work on turning requirements into clear solutions, keeping the UI consistent,
		the logic understandable, and the codebase easy to maintain as the project evolves.`,

		`Front-end development is something I genuinely enjoy and see as a long-term
		direction, not just a job.
		I’m constantly learning, improving my skills, and comfortable working with new
		tools or technologies when a project requires something I haven’t used before.`
